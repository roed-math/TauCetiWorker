"""--ignore-quota overrides PACING, not AVAILABILITY.

A worker pinned to `--agent claude --ignore-quota` is meant to skip the burn-pace throttle, not to fire
review rounds into a provider that is actually out. So the loop still reads the usage endpoint and treats
a HARD block — a window at 100% (exhausted), usage it cannot read (fail-closed), or the endpoint itself
refusing to answer (its own 429 / a network error, which leaves the Provider with no windows) — as a
reason to wait. Only a SOFT over-pace block (real quota left, merely ahead of pace) is run through.

Regression for the loop that re-reviewed the same green PRs up to the daily cap during a subscription
rate-limit, burning a clone + engine launch each round to post an all-error scoreboard. Dependency-free.
